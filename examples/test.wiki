= Jinja24Doc wiki test =

== Paragraph ==
So this is some Jinja24Doc wiki test. First, we test some text
paragraphs with base formating like /italic/, * bold *,
{ monospaced text } and normal external hyperlink to Jinja24Doc
http://jinja24doc.zeropage.cz

== Params ==
Sometime, there could be params in documentation:
    argc - string argument
    argv - number argument

== Codes ==
=== code block with syntax (python by default) ===

    # simple python exmple in code-block (python)
    from cool import notcool

    class Object(object):
       ''' Class documentation '''
        none = None
        true = True
        false = False
        n = int(10)
        s = str('text')

        def __init__(self):
            raise RuntimeError('This is singleton\n') # raise the exception

    try:
        obj = Object()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

    class Foo(Object):
        @staticmethod
        def info():
            return "This is foo \u010d"

    for i in range(100):
        if i > 10 and i < 50:
            print (i*i)

=== doctest code ===
Doctest code is not highlited by default from rst, but,
Jinja24Doc can do that. For examle see the last code, but in doctest
mode:

    >>> @decorator(*args):
    >>> def function(param, **kwargs):
    >>>     """ __doc__ for function """
    >>>     if param is None:
    >>>         raise Exception("Param can't be None")
    >>>     assert (isinstance(param, int))
    >>>     value = param * 2       # some work
    >>>     return value
    >>>
    >>>  try:
    >>>     function()
    >>>  except Exception as e:
    >>>     print(e)
    Exception: Param can't be None


=== Pre block ===
Need some text here...:(

    #!text
    This is indent block, which is formated as block
    only by indenting in source.

And this is process as normal text and as python documentation of module for
example now. :)
